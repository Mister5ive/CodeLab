Image Processing
==============================

Date: 2013-Dec-11

Both codes are writen for CIS*4720 Image Processing course.

Haze Removal are based on:

	K. He, J. Sun, and X. Tang. "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel 
	Prior". In CVPR, IEEE, pp. 1956-1963(2009).

Which the author provide the matlab source code. I just translate it to Python.

Image Contrast Enhancement has two methods, which are implementing two papers respectively:

	N. Bassiou, C. Kotropoulos, "Color Image Histogram Equalization by 
	Absolute Discounting Back-off". Computer Vision and Image Understanding,
	VOL. 107, pp. 108-122(2007).

	T. Arici, S. Dikbas, and Y. Altunbasak, "A Histogram Modfication Framework
	and Its Application for Image Contrast Enhancement". IEEE Trans. on IMAGE 
	PROCESSING, VOL. 18, NO. 9, pp. 1921-1935(2009).

They didn't provide any source codes, I implemented them by my own comprehension of their works.
