This is my lab of consisting full of small programs.

HanoiProgram

This is a hanoi program, which I tried to remember the Recursion logic in programming.

I totally messed it up, and don't know what im writing. Although it finally get the expected result, but it couldn't be called recursion. Hopefully I will fix the code later.

PythonQuine
============
Author: NoahDragon Date: 2013-Nov-20

A simple self-replicating program via Python.

Using the trick of function and string operations, kind of the simplest way to create a quine program.

It could be shorter.

The shotest quine way in python is: "print open(file).read()". (Correction: this is not count as quine, cause it takes input from external file.)

Shoter Quine program shows better comperhensive of programming language. In my opinion, quine is not useful but funny. It could be a test for languae acknowledgement.

SimpleJavaTCPConnection

Just simple code which implement TCP connect, writing in Java code.

The Server.java creates a infinite loop for listening connection request from client, and sends back a message.

The Client.java tried to connect the server, and print out the message.

Just run to compile: javac *.java
and run 'java Server' first, then open another terminal and run 'java Client'.

You will see the server message prompt on client side.
