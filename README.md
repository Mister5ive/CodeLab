CodeLab
=======

This is my lab of consisting full of small programs.

============

HanoiProgram (hanoi.py)
============

Date: 2013-Nov-22

This is a hanoi program, which I tried to remember the Recursion logic in programming.

I totally messed it up, and don't know what im writing. Although it finally get the expected result, but it couldn't be called recursion. Hopefully I will fix the code later.

============

PythonQuine (Quine.py)
============
Date: 2013-Nov-20

A simple self-replicating program via Python.

Using the trick of function and string operations, kind of the simplest way to create a quine program.

It could be shorter.

The shotest quine way in python is: "print open(file).read()". (Correction: this is not count as quine, cause it takes input from external file.)

Shoter Quine program shows better comperhensive of programming language. In my opinion, quine is not useful but funny. It could be a test for languae acknowledgement.

=============

SimpleJavaTCPConnection 
=============

Date: 2013-Nov-18


Just simple code which implement TCP connect, writing in Java code.

The Server.java creates a infinite loop for listening connection request from client, and sends back a message.

The Client.java tried to connect the server, and print out the message.

Just run to compile: javac *.java
and run 'java Server' first, then open another terminal and run 'java Client'.

You will see the server message prompt on client side.

============

Back Propagation for XOR training (BP_XOR.cpp)
============

Date: 2013-Dec-10

This is an assignment code back to 2011 for course Neural Network Algorithm.

Training the BP algorithm to learn XOR operation. 

===============

Prime Number 
===============

Date: 2013-Dec-10

Wrote in C programming language
Compiled by Dev-C/C++ 4.9 & GNU C Compiler
Wrote for: CIS 6650, UoG

This program is focused on calculating the 990,000th prime number and printing 
this prime number on screen.

==================

FuzzyART Neural Network
==================

Date: 2013-Dec-10

Description: this is a work for implement fuzzyART network. It is also an assignment code for Neural Network Course.
Author: Abner
Date: Mar 26th, 2011

===================

Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
==================

Date: 2013-Dec-10

It is also an assignment for Neural Network Course, implementing the Self-Organizing Map network.
