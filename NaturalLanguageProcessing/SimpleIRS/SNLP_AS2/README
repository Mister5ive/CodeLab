Describtion: Assignment 2 for SNLP course(CIS6650)
**************************************************************/

In this folder, there are three sub folders. Each of them implements
a function of Information Retrieval System.

In GenerateQueries&Doc folder, using commond 'make' to generate the
executable file 'scanner'. Using commond './scanner < queries.txt > queries.out' to generate the 'queries.out' file, and using commond 
'./scanner < documents.txt > documents.out' can produce the 
'documents.out' file. This part is pretty similar to assignment 1 for
SNLP.

In Offline folder, using commond 'make' to generate the executable
file 'offline'. Please make sure the 'documents.out' is in the same
folder, then execute './offline'. This will generate three outputs:
dictionary.txt, docids.txt, posting.txt. (These three have already
in the Online folder)

In Online folder, using commond 'make' to generate the executable file
'IRS'. This time please make sure the 'dictionary.txt', 'docids.txt',
and 'posting.txt' in the same folder, and run './IRS'. 

The process of creating this Information Retrieval System is showed
below:
1. Make 'scanner' generate the 'documents.out'.
2. Make 'offline' to process 'documents.out', and output 'dictionary.txt'
 'docids.txt', and 'posting.txt'.
3. Make 'IRS' to run system.

Tought on this assignment
********************************************************************
This is really a challenging assignment, and I found out I learned
more through this assignment. The whole process of Information Retrieval
System is implemented in this one assignment. The time when I successfully
ran the system, I feel great achievability for devoting time and energy on
it.

However, this system I made is still rough. It could not show details very well, and the similarity function I just chose the inner product which is
the simpliest. Moreover, the proccess of scanner can not deal the 
apostrophized word properly, especially when some words quoted with single
quotation mark.
